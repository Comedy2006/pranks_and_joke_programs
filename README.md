# What does this program do?
The title of the repository should be self explaining...
## requirements
This program is coded in Visual Studio Community 2019. If you want to execute that code, you have to go to "Properties > Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies" Go to <Edit...> and write "Winmm.lib" and you should be able to compile it now. Btw you need to be administrator to do that.
## DISCLAIMER
I am not responsible for any damage either on the system or the CD Drive. If you opened your CD Tray too often and it is not working now... your fault.
